# React Router Dom v6 Routes Not Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6: routes failing to render components. The problem stems from a misunderstanding of how Routes and Route components function together.  The provided solution offers a correction and an explanation.

## Problem

The initial `App.js` file contains a seemingly correct setup of React Router v6.  Routes and Route components are used to define various paths, but only the default route renders.  Other routes do not display their components. 

## Solution

The solution is in `AppSolution.js`.  The issue lies in the incorrect use of the Routes component.  The solution corrects this, providing a fully functional implementation of React Router v6 that handles multiple routes successfully.
